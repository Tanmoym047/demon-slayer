<p id = "SlayerHeading3"> Demon Slayer Corps. The Demon Slayer Corps (鬼殺隊, Kisatsutai) is an organization that has existed since ancient times, dedicated to protect humankind from demons. <br> There are hundreds of Demon Slayers within the organization, but they act in secrecy even from the Japanese government. </p>
<h1 id = "SlayerHeading4"> Demon Slayers Ranks </h1>
<p id = "SlayerHeading5"> There are a total of 10 ranks in the Demon Slayer Corps. The lowest rank is Mizunoto, then it goes up to Mizunoe, Kanoto, Kanoe, Tsuchinoto, Tsuchinoe, Hinoto, Hinoe, and Kinoto. The highest rank is Kinoe. <br> <br> When a Demon Slayer passes the gruesome Final Selection, they turn into an official member of the Demon Slayer Corps. As a new member of the organization, their designated rank starts at the lowest, which is Mizunoto. A Demon Slayer can reach the highest rank, Kinoe, by taking a variety of missions and proving themselves as a strong, extremely skilled, and dedicated member. <br> <br> Following the Final Selection, the Demon Slayer goes through a process called “Wisteria Engraving” in which their rank is written on their hand. They can check their rank by saying a password and clenching their fist. The symbol showing their rank will appear on the back of their hand. <br> <br> Aside from the standard 10 Demon Slayer ranks, there are the Hashira and the Tsuguko which rank higher. The Hashira is an elite group in the Demon Slayer Corps. They are the strongest fighters in the organization and are second to the leader. To qualify as a potential Hashira, the Demon Slayer needs to kill 50 demons. Another option is killing a Twelve Kizuki member while having the Kinoe rank. <br> <br> Meanwhile, the Tsuguko is a Demon Slayer who is going to be the successor of one of the Hashira once they pass away or retire. A Demon Slayer needs to apply and get accepted to become a Tsuguko or one of the current Hashira decides to scout them. </p>
<h1 id = "SlayerHeading6"> Demons Ranks </h1>
<p id = "SlayerHeading7"> The Twelve Kizuki is an organization of the 12 strongest beings amongst demon-kind, second in strength and authority only to the Demon King himself, Muzan Kibutsuji. Each member of the Twelve Kizuki has received a large portion of Muzan's blood, greater than any other demon, thus exponentially increasing their power.[1] As a testament to this, every member of the Twelve Kizuki can use Blood Demon Arts, supernatural powers and techniques manifested through their blood that only significantly powerful demons have access to. <br> <br> <br> The Twelve Kizuki are divided into two groups, the six Upper Ranks (上じょう弦げん Jōgen?), numbered one through six, and the six Lower Ranks (下か弦げん Kagen?), also numbered one through six. The number signifies their ranking among the Twelve Kizuki, determined by each member's level of strength, Upper Rank One being the strongest and Lower Rank Six being the weakest. The Lower Ranks have their numbers and ranks engraved only into one eye, whereas the Upper Ranks have their numbers in one eye and the kanji for "Upper Rank" (上じょう弦げん Jōgen?) in the other.</p>
